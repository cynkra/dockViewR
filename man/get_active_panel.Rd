get_active_panel(state)
}
\arguments{
\item{state}{A list containing the dock state data after
calling \code{\link[=dock_view_reactive_proxy]{dock_view_reactive_proxy()}}, typically accessed via
\code{dock[["proxy"]][["data"]]}. Must contain:
\itemize{
\item \code{active_group}: The ID of the currently active group
\item \code{active_views}: A named list mapping group IDs to their active panel IDs
}}
}
\value{
A character string representing the active panel ID.
}
\description{
Retrieves the active panel ID for the currently active group in a dock.
}
\details{
This function is used internally to determine which panel is currently
active within the active group of a dockview. In dockview terminology,
each group can contain multiple panels (e.g., in tabs), but only one
panel per group can be active at a time.
}
\seealso{
\code{\link{select_panel}} for selecting a different panel,
\code{\link{dock_view_proxy}} for creating the dock proxy object
}
